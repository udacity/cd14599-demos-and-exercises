# Exercise: Fix the Failing Test

Welcome to your first debugging mission!  
In **TDD**, a failing test is a gift—it acts as a clear, precise bug report, telling you exactly where the system is broken and what behavior needs fixing.

Your goal is to become familiar with reading the **pytest** output (the traceback) to pinpoint errors and make the minimal necessary code changes to pass the tests.

---

##  Goal

Make all tests pass by correcting logical errors in `src/user_service.py`.

---

##  File Structure

You are working with two files:

- **`src/user_service.py`** — This is the application code that contains a couple of simple bugs. You should **only edit this file**.  
- **`tests/test_user_service.py`** — This contains the test suite written using **pytest**. **Do not edit this file.**

---

## Instructions

### 1 - Run the Tests

Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project. Then run:

```bash
pytest
```

You should see two tests fail (indicated by `F`).

### 2 - Read the Traceback (Your Clues)

For `test_valid_username_boundary_5`:

- Find this section in the traceback.
- Observe what specific value was expected and what the function actually returned.
- This hints at an off-by-one error in the boundary condition.

For `test_calculate_cooldown_boundary_3_attempts`:

- This test expects 3 attempts → 0 cooldown, but the code returns 10.
- This points to an issue with the comparison operator.

### 3 - Fix the Code (The “Green” Step)

Edit `src/user_service.py` and adjust the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) in the buggy functions to align with the intended business logic described in the docstrings.

### 4 - Verify

Run pytest again:

```bash
pytest
```

If you’ve fixed the bugs correctly, all tests should pass!

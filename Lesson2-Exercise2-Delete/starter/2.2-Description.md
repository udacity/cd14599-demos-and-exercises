This is our final practice together audience: implementing a `delete_expense` method using the TDD cycle we've been practicing.

This is a practical application of all the concepts covered so far, including writing tests for new functionality, handling unique identifiers, and ensuring data integrity (total updates).

Walk through the "Your Task" and "Requirements" sections. You  should focus on creating a test that confirms an expense is truly removed and the overall total reflects this removal.

Reiterate the TDD process: write the failing test first, then implement the minimal code to make it pass, and finally refactor for clean code.

Think about edge cases, such as attempting to delete a non-existent expense, though the main challenge focuses on successful deletion.

This practice s a good checkpoint to ensure everyone has grasped the core principles before moving on to the solution.

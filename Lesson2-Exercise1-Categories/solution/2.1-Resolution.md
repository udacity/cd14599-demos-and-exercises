# Solution

This exercise is designed to give you hands-on experience with the full TDD cycle.

- Step 1: You added a new test that checks if an expense can be stored with a category name.

- Step 2: You made that test pass with the simplest code possible.

- Step 3: Next, you introduced a new feature: filtering expenses by category. Before writing any implementation code, you wrote a test that described the intended behavior. The test failed because this feature wasn't yet implemented.

- Step 4:  Finally, with your filtering test failing, you wrote just enough code to make it pass. 

```python
def test_add_expense_with_category():    
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()    
    tracker.add_expense(10, category="food")    
    # We assume a list called .expenses exists    
    assert tracker.expenses[0]['category'] == "food"
```

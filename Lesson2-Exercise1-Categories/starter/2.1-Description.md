# Write the Failing Test (Red Phase)
Exercise: Defining a New Feature with a Failing Test
Your current ExpenseTracker allows adding an amount but doesn't track what the expense was for. Your task is to start implementing a new feature: adding an expense category.

According to TDD, we must start by writing a test that clearly defines this new requirement and fails immediately.

# Goal
Write a new test function that asserts an expense can be stored with a category. The test should fail when run.

- Files to Work With
tests/test_tracker.py (The file you will edit)

src/tracker.py (The existing application code—DO NOT EDIT IT YET)

# The Feature to Test
The ExpenseTracker class currently has the method signature: add_expense(self, amount)

You need to write a test that expects the new method signature to accept a category argument: add_expense(self, amount, category)

# Instructions
- Open tests/test_tracker.py.

- Write a new test function called test_add_expense_can_store_category.

- Inside the test, assert the following behavior:

- Add an expense, supplying both an amount and a category string (e.g., "food").

- Assert that the expense data stored internally in the tracker contains this category string. (You'll need to know where your application stores its expense records, likely a self.expenses list or dictionary).

- Expected Outcome (RED)
When you run pytest after writing this test, it should fail with a TypeError because your test calls add_expense with an extra argument (category), but the implementation in src/tracker.py isn't ready for it yet.
